# Facebook Group Scraper

This repo is used for scraping data from a facebook group. It returns a dataframe with posts and comments and some more information.

### To use
1. Create Login.py (which won't be tracked because of the gitignore), fill in the following:

> EMAIL = "your email"
> PASSWORD = "your password"

2. Download a chromedriver matching your chrome version (a simple Google search should do the trick).
