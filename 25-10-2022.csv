"FEMALE HOUSEMATE WANTED BY NOV 15! (Dutch only)Dear room seekers,Do you want to become part of the Martini family? Then we hope to welcome you in our home from +/- 15 Nov! Because one of our housemates is leaving us, we are looking for a nice spontaneous girl from the age of 20. The division in the house is currently 3 women, 2 men and you would then be part of that. In our home there are few obligations, but there are always people at home who are in for fun. This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l. The good thing about this room is that your bed is already there, you just have to bring a mattress and you can move in. So you sleep (as seen in the pictures) in a built-in bunk bed, so you have all the space left to decorate. Because of that you can easily get rid of a couch, where we can chill again . We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time. The Albert Heijn is also around the corner and within 10 minutes of cycling you'll be at the station.Are you looking for a room and would you like to come and live with us? Will you also be there on our date of the viewing evening, 27 October?

This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l.

We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time. The Albert Heijn is also around the corner and within 10 minutes of cycling you'll be at the station.Are you looking for a room and would you like to come and live with us?

In our home there are few obligations, but there are always people at home who are in for fun. This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l. The good thing about this room is that your bed is already there, you just have to bring a mattress and you can move in. So you sleep (as seen in the pictures) in a built-in bunk bed, so you have all the space left to decorate. Because of that you can easily get rid of a couch, where we can chill again . We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time. The Albert Heijn is also around the corner and within 10 minutes of cycling you'll be at the station.Are you looking for a room and would you like to come and live with us? Will you also be there on our date of the viewing evening, 27 October? Send an email quickly to kijkavondmartini@gmail.com , briefly tell us who you are, what you do, send a nice picture of yourself and who knows you might be invited to our viewing evening!Who knows, see you soon!Greetings from the house of Martini",True,13,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1379345962387168/posts/3360743794247365/

Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting. Rent 588 incl gwl (probably to be adjusted, *insert sadface*), excluding home insurance (5th p/m), cleaner (26th p/m)The living room is beautiful and practically furnished. We have a large Beamer with thick speakers. In addition, there is a real piano, a fake drum set (electric) and a piece or 4 guitars.The garden is huge and by now we have turned this into a vegetable garden. Unfortunately, the garden could use a little more love. So green fingers are more than welcome! Oh yeah, there's a homemade jacuzzi in the garden. How cool is that?Who are we?Robert. This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions. Furthermore, this float is now addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So be careful not to be put in a neck brace upon entering.Cow. This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop. Occasionally he sports (mountain biking, running, cycling, kite-buggy, squash, skating, triathlons, snowboarding).Do you know someone who is still looking for a room with a nice company, who would fit in with us, then don't hesitate to ""tag"" them in this post or send one of us a message.Greetings Koen and Robert (and the house leaver, Tim Assman )",True,1,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1379345962387168/posts/3359070244414720/

The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting.

"Orchids Palace Eindhoven is looking for a new male roommate as of November 1, 2022 (later is also definitely possible)!Are you now comfortable at work and between 28 and 35 years (not very strict)? Do you like cooking & eating together? Do you want to live with Robert (29) and Koen (35), are you a bit musical, and a bit sporty, do you like chores (aka legs), and do you identify as a man? Read on right away!We have a beautiful private house in the south of Eindhoven with spacious garden AND carport for all your bikes. The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting. Rent 588 incl gwl (probably to be adjusted, *insert sadface*), excluding home insurance (5th p/m), cleaner (26th p/m)The living room is beautiful and practically furnished. We have a large Beamer with thick speakers. In addition, there is a real piano, a fake drum set (electric) and a piece or 4 guitars.The garden is huge and by now we have turned this into a vegetable garden. Unfortunately, the garden could use a little more love. So green fingers are more than welcome! Oh yeah, there's a homemade jacuzzi in the garden. How cool is that?Who are we?Robert. This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions. Furthermore, this float is now addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So be careful not to be put in a neck brace upon entering.Cow. This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop. Occasionally he sports (mountain biking, running, cycling, kite-buggy, squash, skating, triathlons, snowboarding).Do you know someone who is still looking for a room with a nice company, who would fit in with us, then don't hesitate to ""tag"" them in this post or send one of us a message.Greetings Koen and Robert (and the house leaver, Tim Assman )",True,1,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1379345962387168/posts/3359070244414720/

The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting.

This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions.

This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop.

This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l. The good thing about this room is that your bed is already there, you just have to bring a mattress and you can move in. So you sleep (as seen in the pictures) in a built-in bunk bed, so you have all the space left to decorate. Because of that you can easily get rid of a couch, where we can chill again . We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time. The Albert Heijn is also around the corner and within 10 minutes of cycling you'll be at the station.Are you looking for a room and would you like to come and live with us?

The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting.

In addition, there is a real piano, a fake drum set (electric) and a piece or 4 guitars.The garden is huge and by now we have turned this into a vegetable garden.

This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions. Furthermore, this float is now addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So be careful not to be put in a neck brace upon entering.Cow. This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop.

Because one of our housemates is leaving us, we are looking for a nice spontaneous girl from the age of 20. The division in the house is currently 3 women, 2 men and you would then be part of that. In our home there are few obligations, but there are always people at home who are in for fun. This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l. The good thing about this room is that your bed is already there, you just have to bring a mattress and you can move in. So you sleep (as seen in the pictures) in a built-in bunk bed, so you have all the space left to decorate. Because of that you can easily get rid of a couch, where we can chill again . We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time.

"Orchids Palace Eindhoven is looking for a new male roommate as of November 1, 2022 (later is also definitely possible)!Are you now comfortable at work and between 28 and 35 years (not very strict)? Do you like cooking & eating together? Do you want to live with Robert (29) and Koen (35), are you a bit musical, and a bit sporty, do you like chores (aka legs), and do you identify as a man? Read on right away!We have a beautiful private house in the south of Eindhoven with spacious garden AND carport for all your bikes. The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting. Rent 588 incl gwl (probably to be adjusted, *insert sadface*), excluding home insurance (5th p/m), cleaner (26th p/m)The living room is beautiful and practically furnished. We have a large Beamer with thick speakers. In addition, there is a real piano, a fake drum set (electric) and a piece or 4 guitars.The garden is huge and by now we have turned this into a vegetable garden. Unfortunately, the garden could use a little more love. So green fingers are more than welcome! Oh yeah, there's a homemade jacuzzi in the garden. How cool is that?Who are we?Robert. This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions. Furthermore, this float is now addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So be careful not to be put in a neck brace upon entering.Cow. This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop. Occasionally he sports (mountain biking, running, cycling, kite-buggy, squash, skating, triathlons, snowboarding).Do you know someone who is still looking for a room with a nice company, who would fit in with us, then don't hesitate to ""tag"" them in this post or send one of us a message.Greetings Koen and Robert (and the house leaver, Tim Assman )",True,1,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1379345962387168/posts/3359070244414720/

The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting. Rent 588 incl gwl (probably to be adjusted, *insert sadface*), excluding home insurance (5th p/m), cleaner (26th p/m)The living room is beautiful and practically furnished.

In addition, there is a real piano, a fake drum set (electric) and a piece or 4 guitars.The garden is huge and by now we have turned this into a vegetable garden.

This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions. Furthermore, this float is now addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So be careful not to be put in a neck brace upon entering.Cow. This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop.

"FEMALE HOUSEMATE WANTED BY NOV 15! (Dutch only)Dear room seekers,Do you want to become part of the Martini family? Then we hope to welcome you in our home from +/- 15 Nov! Because one of our housemates is leaving us, we are looking for a nice spontaneous girl from the age of 20. The division in the house is currently 3 women, 2 men and you would then be part of that. In our home there are few obligations, but there are always people at home who are in for fun. This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l. The good thing about this room is that your bed is already there, you just have to bring a mattress and you can move in. So you sleep (as seen in the pictures) in a built-in bunk bed, so you have all the space left to decorate. Because of that you can easily get rid of a couch, where we can chill again . We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time. The Albert Heijn is also around the corner and within 10 minutes of cycling you'll be at the station.Are you looking for a room and would you like to come and live with us?

The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting. Rent 588 incl gwl (probably to be adjusted, *insert sadface*), excluding home insurance (5th p/m), cleaner (26th p/m)The living room is beautiful and practically furnished. We have a large Beamer with thick speakers. In addition, there is a real piano, a fake drum set (electric) and a piece or 4 guitars.The garden is huge and by now we have turned this into a vegetable garden. Unfortunately, the garden could use a little more love. So green fingers are more than welcome! Oh yeah, there's a homemade jacuzzi in the garden. How cool is that?Who are we?Robert. This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions. Furthermore, this float is now addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So be careful not to be put in a neck brace upon entering.Cow. This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop.

"FEMALE HOUSEMATE WANTED BY NOV 15! (Dutch only)Dear room seekers,Do you want to become part of the Martini family? Then we hope to welcome you in our home from +/- 15 Nov! Because one of our housemates is leaving us, we are looking for a nice spontaneous girl from the age of 20. The division in the house is currently 3 women, 2 men and you would then be part of that. In our home there are few obligations, but there are always people at home who are in for fun. This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l. The good thing about this room is that your bed is already there, you just have to bring a mattress and you can move in. So you sleep (as seen in the pictures) in a built-in bunk bed, so you have all the space left to decorate. Because of that you can easily get rid of a couch, where we can chill again . We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time. The Albert Heijn is also around the corner and within 10 minutes of cycling you'll be at the station.Are you looking for a room and would you like to come and live with us? Will you also be there on our date of the viewing evening, 27 October?

The house is 12 min by bike from the central station, 3 min from the park and 1 min from the supermarket. We share a spacious living room, kitchen, attic and a very luxurious 'bathroom'. Oh yeah, we turned the kitchen into a disco incl microphone, lasers and smoke machine. So cleaning out the dishwasher is often a festive occasion.The room! You have a nice spacious room of 17 m2 and spacious walk-in closet, see pictures. Did we already use the word 'space'? South facing windows, so lots of light, on a quiet street. There are some things to take over, such as curtains and lighting. Rent 588 incl gwl (probably to be adjusted, *insert sadface*), excluding home insurance (5th p/m), cleaner (26th p/m)The living room is beautiful and practically furnished. We have a large Beamer with thick speakers. In addition, there is a real piano, a fake drum set (electric) and a piece or 4 guitars.The garden is huge and by now we have turned this into a vegetable garden. Unfortunately, the garden could use a little more love. So green fingers are more than welcome! Oh yeah, there's a homemade jacuzzi in the garden. How cool is that?Who are we?Robert. This man jumps into the cold water like Wim Hof and focuses a lot on personal development, mindfulness and spirituality. He is open, analytical and likes to ask good questions. Furthermore, this float is now addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So be careful not to be put in a neck brace upon entering.Cow. This handyman will have his own handyman company in 10 years, even though he doesn't know it himself yet. Not crazy that he rented out the garage behind the yard and turned it into a workshop.

"FEMALE HOUSEMATE WANTED BY NOV 15! (Dutch only)Dear room seekers,Do you want to become part of the Martini family? Then we hope to welcome you in our home from +/- 15 Nov! Because one of our housemates is leaving us, we are looking for a nice spontaneous girl from the age of 20. The division in the house is currently 3 women, 2 men and you would then be part of that. In our home there are few obligations, but there are always people at home who are in for fun. This ranges from a night out to watching a movie on the couch, house nights or just having a nice drink.The room is 12m2 + 3m2 and the rent is 350,- including G/w/l. The good thing about this room is that your bed is already there, you just have to bring a mattress and you can move in. So you sleep (as seen in the pictures) in a built-in bunk bed, so you have all the space left to decorate. Because of that you can easily get rid of a couch, where we can chill again . We have a joint kitchen in which we often chill or eat together occasionally, a great garden where we can catch the sun and an ideal location, because you'll be at Stratum or the Kleine Berg in no time. The Albert Heijn is also around the corner and within 10 minutes of cycling you'll be at the station.Are you looking for a room and would you like to come and live with us? Will you also be there on our date of the viewing evening, 27 October? Send an email quickly to kijkavondmartini@gmail.com , briefly tell us who you are, what you do, send a nice picture of yourself and who knows you might be invited to our viewing evening!Who knows, see you soon!Greetings from the house of Martini",True,13,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1379345962387168/posts/3360743794247365/
